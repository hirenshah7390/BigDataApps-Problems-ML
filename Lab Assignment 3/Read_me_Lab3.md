Q-1 k-mean, k-median, expectation maximization, hierarchical algorithm with R.

K-means :- We are collecting the heart bit rate from the wear, so we are using k-means algorithm to find the cluster of BPM with our set of collected sample data. 

Hierarchical Clustering: Hierarchical clustering is clustering algorithm for combining data into one cluster or dividing them up to individual cluster. It doesn’t have cluster known on prior basis. We don’t define cluster like k-means here. The output of this is Dendogram.

K-Medoids:- Like k-means clustering here also we need to define number of clusters. Medoids are similar in concept to means or centroids, but medoids are always members of the data set. Medoids are most commonly used on data when a mean or centroid cannot be defined such as 3-D trajectories or in the gene expression context.

Expectation Maximization: In statistics, an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method for finding maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of parameters in statistical models, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables.

Q-2 I collected data from smart wear for heart rate and steps using sensor services.
